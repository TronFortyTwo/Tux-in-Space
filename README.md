the phisic's laws, of planets, spaceships, suns, and everything else in

impacts between objects

test/use the program:
-------------------------
There is an executable file, compiled in a 64 bit Linux; Maybe can run
in other computers as well, but you can easily compile the program with
the makefile (just run 'make' in the master directory).

The program is written for linux only, but with very few work or maybe no work at all could also
run on other operative systems. (See information file)

Officially supported compiler is gcc >= 6.3.

For developers is suggested to use the latest version in the 
master branch, for normal users the latest release.

Status
------
The program is far far away from being complete.
