# CSpace
CSpace: the space simulator

This program is a simulator game. The program simulates the moving, under the phisic's law, of planets, spaceships, suns, and everything else in the deep space.
Now have:
- An extended gerarchic collection of various object types whit different behavior
- Phisic engine that simulate the gravity force and the impacts between the objects whit different types of impact
- Space Monster whit IA

for test/use the program:
-------------------------
There are two executable files (cspace-dev and cspace-opt), compiled in a Linux 64 bit. Maybe they can run in other computers.
You can compile the program easily whit the makefile, but you need some developer and runtime SDL2 packages.
The cspace-opt executable should be the fastest, but isn't compiled whit the '-g' flag, so isn't recommended for developing purpose, while the cspace-dev executable isn't faster as the cspace-opt executable but is recommended for testing and developing.
The program is programmed for linux only, but whit very few work can also run on other operative systems(See information file).
You are encouraged enjoy and test this program.
