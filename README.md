# CSpace
CSpace: the space's simulator

This program is a simulator. I don't decided if is a game or a 'professional' simulator or both of two yet.
The program simulates the moving, under the phisic's law, of planets, spaceships, suns, or elsewhere;
whit the possibility of piloting spaceship alredy created in this system, that a user can creates and modify easily.
The power of the program sits in its language: the C, and in its graphic motor, that creat elastic ASCII interface that adapts on screen size

for test/use the program:
-------------------------
There is a Main executable file, compiled in a Debian 64 bit. Maybe can run in other computer.
Elsewhere, you can compile the main whit "gcc -lm -Wall -o -g main.c <destination_file>". You are encouraged of start use or test this program.
