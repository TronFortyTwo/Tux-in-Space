# CSpace
CSpace: the pure C space's simulator

This program is a simulator. I don't decided if is a game or a 'professional' simulator or both of two yet.
The program simulates the moving, under the phisic's law, of planets, spaceships, suns, and everything else.

for test/use the program:
-------------------------
There is a Main executable file, compiled in a Linux 64 bit. Maybe can run in other computers.
Elsewhere, you can compile the program easily whit "gcc -Wall -o -g main.c destination_file -lm -lpthread" in the master directory.
You are encouraged enjoy and test this program.

Status
------
The program is in alpha status: this mean that the code is far away from being complete, but is alredy usable, even whit many bugs and ugly things
