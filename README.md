# CSpace
CSpace: the pure C space's simulator

This program is a simulator. I don't decided if is a game or a 'professional' simulator or both of two yet.
The program simulates the moving, under the phisic's law, of planets, spaceships, suns, or something else.

for test/use the program:
-------------------------
There is a Main executable file, compiled in a Linux 64 bit. Maybe can run in other computers.
Elsewhere, you can compile the program easily whit "gcc -lm -Wall -o -g main.c destination_file" in the master directory.
The program needs these library for now: stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, math.h.
You are encouraged of start use and test this program.

Status
------
The program is in pre-alpha status: this mean that the code is far from being complete.

Future version:  
ALPHA 1: this version will be released when the program has a scheleton of all its principal component
