# CSpace
CSpace: the space's simulator

This program is a simulator. I don't decided if is a game or a 'professional' simulator or both of two yet.
The program simulates the moving, under the phisic's law, of planets, spaceships, suns, or elsewhere;
whit the possibility of piloting spaceship alredy created in this system, that a user can creates and modify easily.
The power of the program sits in its language: the C, and in its graphic motor: a ASCII render interface heavily and easily hackable/modifiable

for test/use the program:
-------------------------
There is a Main executable file, compiled in a Debian 64 bit. Maybe can run in other computers.
Elsewhere, you can compile the program easily whit "gcc -lm -Wall -o -g main.c destination_file" in the master directory. You are encouraged of start use and test this program.
