CSpace: the space's simulator

This program is a simulator. I don't yet decided if is a game or a 'professional' simulator or both of two.
The program simulates the moving, under the phisic's law, of planets, spaceship, sun, or elsewhere;
whit the possibility of piloting spaceship alredy created in this system, that a user can create and modify easily.
The power of the program sits in its language: the C, and in the graphic motor, that creat elastic ASCII interface that adapts on screen size
