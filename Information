MISUR UNIT

	These are the misure unit that I use on the program:

	lenght:		Km	(1000 m)
	mass:		t	(1000 Kg)
	time:		s


INT kind: IN OBJ STRUCT

	-- Visible --
	1  = Spaceship
	2  = Sun
	3  = Planet (generic)
	4  = Planet (Rock)
	5  = Planet (Giant Gas)
	6  = Natural satellite
	7  = Asteroid
	8  = Comet
	9  = Black Hole
	10 = Space station
	-- Background --
	0  = Null. there isn't any object in this obj position
	11 = Not allocated but present (unknowed)
	>11 | <0 = Unexpected kind (considered 0)

EXIT STATUS

	When a function exit alwais give an int value to the calling function. This is a legend of which exit status are now present:
	
	0 = All is went well. Excelent!
	1 = Variable kind not valid
	2 = Unknow exit status
	3 = var's size wrong
	4 = Overflow
